Built secure API communication channels and designed workflows for label generation.
Applied performance tuning techniques to reduce latency in interactions with Royal Mail services, leading to significant improvements in system responsiveness.
Feature Toggling & Phased Rollout:
Designed and implemented a dynamic feature toggling system for controlled, phased deployments.
Successfully onboarded over 270 stores in a staged rollout, ensuring zero downtime and a smooth transition.
Dropship Application – Key Achievements
Testing & Deployment Pipelines:
Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployments using GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps.
Wrote integration and E2E tests to ensure platform stability.
BDD Strategy Implementation:
Introduced and adopted the BDD approach to bridge the gap between business stakeholders and developers/testers.
Promoted collaboration using Gherkin syntax (Given-When-Then) to clearly describe user stories and expected behavior.
Go-Live & Monitoring:
Successfully launched the application in Inventory Mediator, Dropship Order Mediator, and CC Mediator production environments.
Set up logging, monitoring (Azure Monitor), and alerting to ensure smooth operations.
Wrote alerts and created dashboards to facilitate easy monitoring and quick resolution of production issues.
Spring Boot Upgrade & Codebase Optimization – Key Achievements
Spring Boot Upgrade Across Applications:
Successfully upgraded all microservices from older Spring Boot versions to the latest stable release (e.g., Spring Boot 3.x).
Ensured compatibility with new features like Jakarta EE namespace changes, and migrated deprecated components.
Updated related dependencies (e.g., Spring Cloud, Spring Security) to match the upgraded framework version, ensuring seamless integration.
Dependency & Module Synchronization:
Audited and cleaned up Gradle configurations across the codebase to ensure consistent, conflict-free builds.
Standardized versions of shared libraries and third-party dependencies to reduce runtime issues and simplify future maintenance.
Improved build reliability and reduced CI/CD pipeline failures due to dependency mismatches.
SonarQube Code Quality Enhancements:
Resolved high and medium-priority SonarQube issues, including code smells, bugs, and security vulnerabilities.
Refactored legacy code and applied clean coding principles to enhance maintainability and readability.
Achieved a significantly improved Sonar Quality Gate score, contributing to better long-term health of the codebase.
Testing and Validation:
Conducted comprehensive regression testing to ensure business functionality remained intact post-upgrade.
Enhanced existing test cases and increased code coverage where gaps were identified.
Collaborated with QA and DevOps teams to verify stability across dev, QA, and production environments.
Deployment and Monitoring:
Successfully deployed the upgraded and optimized services to Azure Kubernetes with minimal incidents.
Monitored post-deployment metrics to confirm performance improvements and system reliability.
Production Support Achievements:
Delivered consistent and reliable production support for mission-critical applications such as Dropship and ISF, ensuring smooth operations across multiple integrated services like Inventory Mediator, Order Mediators, CC Mediator, Carrier Gateway, and Store Collection.
Improved incident response efficiency by streamlining log analysis, root cause identification, and resolution processes, significantly reducing Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR).
Collaborated closely with development, infrastructure, and business teams to implement hotfixes, validate deployments, and ensure SLA compliance in a high-pressure production environment.
Delivering 24x7 production support, including incident monitoring, troubleshooting, and coordination with cross-functional teams to maintain application stability."
